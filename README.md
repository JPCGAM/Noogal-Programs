# Noogal-Programs
A unified repository of all of my programs created for NoogalVerse stuff.
There are three main sections for it, the political programs, the space programs and the battle programs.
Throughout them, I use a numbering system, with said numbering being "##.@", with the "##" being the version of the program, and the "@" being the status. A @ of 0 means the program is not in use, while a 1 means it is in use. A 2 means that it is in testing but it would be rare for me to upload either a ".0" or ".2".

The political programs are mainly composed of 3 programs:
- 2 programs that design random political parties, often with conflicting ideologies for the 01 version
- The "Election Simulator Ultimate", is meant to be the main program to use for elections.
- And the "Municipal style" program "part 0"; this is meant as a way to generate a long (like 100 or more regions) CountryData file to not do it by hand. Although it likely needs some work as I made it before I made quite a lot of changes to the election simulator.

I also addedd two text files, "CountryData.txt", an example of what a file could look like, and "CountryData - Template.txt", which shows what each value on the file is.

Then there are the space programs:
- The first program picks some random number of biomes to give to a planet based on its type, temperature ranges and other bits. Mainly used for my worldbuilding so not exactly realistic.
- The second is "Atmospheric DV Estimator", this program takes account of various characteristics of a planet and tries to estimate how much Delta-V a rocket would need to reach orbit just outside its atmosphere. It was rather hard to come up with the various bits of data, and thus ended up using stuff based on Earth and Venus to develop the equations. Because for some reason there is like nothing public that calculates it!
- Finally, there is "solar system generator", this was an attempt at a program that generates a random solar system. It was more of a test than anything, but someone might like messing with it.

Lastly, there are the battle simulators, currently not yet uploaded.
